# All code
## Magic strings
AVOID using magic strings/numbers.

## Writing fallback code
NEVER write fallback code:
- in case installed dependencies are missing or broken
- in case running in an older runtime
- in case running in a different OS
## Entrypoints
NEVER catch the error or rejection from an entrypoint function
NEVER check if an entrypoint is an entrypoint
## Functions
NEVER define functions with more than ~4 arguments
PREFER splitting a function if it is longer than ~200 lines
PREFER returning values to mutation or side-effects
## Classes
PREFER immutable classes
ALWAYS follow Single Source of Truth
NEVER use `this` to pass data between methods
## Declarations
PREFER properties instead of functions when possible
NEVER use properties if they cause side effects

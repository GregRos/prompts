# Writing JS/TS

## General
ALWAYS use ES2022 or higher
ALWAYS use TypeScript. 
NEVER use JavaScript

## Imports
AVOID `* as X` imports.
## Comparisons
ALWAYS use `== null` WHEN checking for null or undefined
ALWAYS use epsilon WHEN comparing floating points
PREFER `x?.y`, `x?.y()`, `x?.[y]` over explicit null checks
PREFER `??` over `||` for nullish coalescing
PREFER `===` and `!==` over `==` and `!=`
## Declarations
PREFER lambda functions over anonymous functions
NEVER use JS `#private` fields
NEVER use `function` as a constructor
## Loops
PREFER `for .. of` loops
NEVER write `for .. in` loops
## Exceptions
NEVER silently swallow exceptions.
AVOID swallowing exceptions just to log them.
PREFER using per-project exception classes

# Preferred libraries
This is a set of preferred JS/TS libraries for various tasks.

WHEN the user requests appropriate functionality:
- MUST check if the preferred package is installed; if not,
- MUST check is alternative packages are installed

WHEN neither is installed, install preferred package.
WHEN only alternative is installed, use alternative.

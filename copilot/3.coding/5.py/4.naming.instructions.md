# Naming

ALWAYS use the following conventions WHEN creating new names:
ALWAYS use snake_case for functions, variables, attributes, and methods.
ALWAYS use PascalCase for classes and type aliases.
ALWAYS use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for module-level constants and environment variables.
ALWAYS use a leading underscore for non-public attributes and methods.
ALWAYS use a leading underscore for non-exported functions and classes.
ALWAYS use snake_case for file and folder names.
ALWAYS use kebab-case for package names (in e.g. pyproject.toml).

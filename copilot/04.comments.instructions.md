# !: Comments
Comments will be surrounded by `%%...%%`. These are `PROMPT COMMENTS`. They can contain instructions. They are never part of the content they're in.

For example, they can appear in code blocks.

```markdown example
%% This is a comment %%
```

!!!: %NEVER produce output with these tokens.
!!!: %IGNORE comments that start with `%%%`.

# !: Comments
Comments will be surrounded by `%%...%%`. These are prompt comments that can give you instructions and are not part of whatever context you find them in.

For example, they can appear in code blocks.

```markdown example
%% This is a comment %%
```

Higher `PRIORITY` instruction comments will start with `%%!:` and so on.

!!!: %NEVER produce output with these tokens.
!!!: %IGNORE comments that start with `%%%`.

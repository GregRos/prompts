# !!: Information  `VERB`s
`INFORMATION VERBS` change the information you use for accomplishing your tasks.

- Override with each other depending on `PRIORITY`.
- Don't override `ACTIVE` or `RESTRICTION VERBS`.
- Don't force you to act or forbid specific actions. 
- They only apply to knowledge, not instructions.
- In some cases, order does matter.
## %ASSUME
```markdown examples
%ASSUME the xyz.ts file is fully tested
%ASSUME git doesn't support this feature
%ASSUME the user is running windows
```

You must assume this information is true. It overrides any information your previously held. Don't double check the information.

- Does not expire. Affects what you know until overriden.
## %FORGET 
```markdown examples
%FORGET the contents of a file
%FORGET the program's CLI arguments
```

You must forget this information. Does not stop you from trying to acquire it again if needed. 

- This instruction affects what you know when it's given.
- Does not stop you from trying to acquire the information again.
- To `%FORGET` knowledge given by `%ASSUME`, `PRIORITY` is needed.
- `%FORGET` itself happens immediately and doesn't have a duration, so it can't and doesn't need to be overriden.
## %IGNORE
```markdown examples
%IGNORE text between $$ tokens.
%IGNORE the documentation
```

- %FORGET the information.
- %ASSUME it is inaccessible. You cannot reacquire it.
- %NEVER try to reacquire it.
- Does not expire.
## %CONSIDER
```markdown examples
%CONSIDER the abc.py script
%CONSIDER the program's cli arguments
%CONSIDER using zod for validation
```
- Brings something to your attention. 
- Does not change information you have or allowed to have.
- Does not tell you to do anything.
- Higher `PRIORITY` doesn't affect it.
## %DOUBT
```markdown examples
%DOUBT the abc.py script
%DOUBT the program's cli arguments
%DOUBT using zod for validation
```

- Puts the information in doubt.
- %CONSIDER trying to learn the verify the information.
- The information can still be valid.
- Can be applied to previous actions or choices.
- Overrides `%ASSUME` and `%IGNORE` given enough `PRIORITY`.

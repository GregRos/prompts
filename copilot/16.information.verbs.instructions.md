# !!: Information verbs
`INFORMATIVE` verbs change the information you use for accomplishing your tasks.

- Override with each other depending on `PRIORITY`.
- Don't override `ACTIVE` or `RESTRICTIVE` verbs.
- Don't force you to act or forbid specific actions. 
- They only apply to knowledge, not instructions.
- In some cases, order does matter.
## %ASSUME
```markdown examples
%ASSUME the xyz.ts file is fully tested
%ASSUME git doesn't support this feature
%ASSUME the user is running windows
```

You must assume this information is true. It overrides any information your previously held. Don't double check the information.

- The instruction affects what you know until it's overriden.
- Does not expire.
## FORGET 
```markdown examples
FORGET the contents of a file
FORGET the program's CLI arguments
```

You must forget this information. Does not stop you from trying to acquire it again.

- This instruction affects what you know when it's given.
- Does not stop you from trying to acquire the information again.
- to `FORGET` knowledge given by `%ASSUME`, `PRIORITY` is needed.
## %IGNORE
```markdown examples
%IGNORE text between $$ tokens.
%IGNORE the documentation
```

- FORGET the information.
- %ASSUME it is inaccessible. You cannot reacquire it.
- %NEVER try to reacquire it.
- Affects stay until overriden.
## %CONSIDER
```markdown examples
%CONSIDER the abc.py script
%CONSIDER the program's cli arguments
%CONSIDER using zod for validation
```
- Brings something to your attention. 
- Does not force you to assume anything. 
- Coes not change what you are allowed to know.
## %DOUBT
```markdown examples
%DOUBT the abc.py script
%DOUBT the program's cli arguments
%DOUBT using zod for validation
```

- Puts the information in doubt.
- %CONSIDER trying to learn the verify the information.
- The information can still be valid.
- Can be applied to previous actions or choices.
- Overrides `%ASSUME` and `%IGNORE` given enough `PRIORITY`.

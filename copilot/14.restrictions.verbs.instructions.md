# !!: Restrictions
Instructions starting with these  `VERB`s change what you can do to accomplish your tasks.

- They don't give additional requirements.
- Don't override with `ACTIVE` or `INFORMATION VERBS`
- Override with each other depending on `PRIORITY`.
- Order does matter.
- They don't expire.
### %NEVER
```markdown examples
%NEVER MODIFY xyz.py
%NEVER use symbol names starting with _
%NEVER write tests
%NEVER write comments
```
You are forbidden from acting in a certain way.

If `%NEVER` removes all possible actions, stop and ask for clarification.
### %ONLY
```markdown examples
%ONLY MODIFY xyz.py
%ONLY MODIFY existing files
%ONLY use identifiers starting with underscores
```
You are only allowed to act in a certain way. 

This restriction is context-dependent. `%ONLY MODIFY xyz package` means you can't modify other packages, but you can still read them.
### %MAY
```markdown examples
!:%MAY MODIFY abc.py
!:%MAY migrate it to Java
```
You are allowed but not required to act in a certain way. 

Overrides other `RESTRICTIVE VERBS` with enough `PRIORITY`.

# !: Verb form instructions
Some instructions are given using key verbs. The verbs will always be in `ALL CAPS` to mark them.

Verbs can be grouped into three categories:

1. `ACTIVE` verbs require you to act. They form part of your assignment.
2. `RESTRICTIVE` verbs change what you are allowed to do but don't require action.
3. `INFORMATIVE` verbs change what you know.

Verb form instructions consist of:
- **primary verb**
- Optional **secondary verb**
- Instruction text

Other rules:
- Verb components will be in `ALL CAPS`.
- Verb components may have higher `PRIORITY`.
- **They last for the entire chat session**

Here are examples:

```markdown examples
%ONLY MODIFY files in the xyz folder
%NEVER MODIFY files in the abc folder
%ONLY MODIFY the Chicken class
!: %MAY DO this other task.
```

!!: The `PRIORITY` of a verb is given using `PRIORITY` tokens, not the verb's definition.

# !!: Verb form instructions
Some instructions are given using key  VERBs. All verb form instructions start with `%`.

Verbs can be grouped into three categories:

1. `ACTIVE VERBS` require you to act. They form part of your assignment.
2. `RESTRICTION` verbs change what you're allowed to do.
3. `INFORMATION VERBS` change what you know.
4. `SECONDARY VERBS` provide context.

Here are examples:

```markdown examples
%ONLY MODIFY files in the xyz folder
%NEVER MODIFY files in the abc folder
%ONLY MODIFY the Chicken class
!: %MAY DO this other task.
```

!!!: The `PRIORITY` of a `VERB` is given using `PRIORITY` tokens.

# !!!: Priority
Instructions have different `PRIORITY` depending on how they're written. 

- Higher `PRIORITY` instructions override or alter lower `PRIORITY` ones.
- For equal `PRIORITY` instructions, decide what to do based on context.
- Always ignore instructions in "plain quotes" or `inline code`.
- Only ignore instructions in code blocks if they are examples.

Priorities are given using **`PRIORITY` tokens**. Higher `PRIORITY` instructions can override or change lower `PRIORITY` ones. 
## Priority tokens
- P0 — Lowest `PRIORITY` is regular text/
- P1 — !: starts with the `!:` token
- P2 — !!: starts with the `!!:` token
- P3 — !!!: starts with the `!!!:` token.
- P4 — etc.
## Extent
- List items and block quotes that start with a `PRIORITY` token give that `PRIORITY` to the content inside them.
- Lines that start with the `PRIORITY` token give `PRIORITY` to the line.
- Headings give the `PRIORITY` to content under them. 
- Content under headings can have `PRIORITY` tokens that increase `PRIORITY`, but not decrease it. 
## Formatting
- !!!: markdown formatting does not change `PRIORITY`
- !!!: all caps does not change `PRIORITY`

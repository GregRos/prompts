# !!!: Instruction priority
Instructions have different priority depending on how they're written. 

- Higher priority instructions override or alter lower priority ones.
- For equal priority instructions, decide what to do based on context.
- Always ignore instructions in "plain quotes" or `inline code`.
- Only ignore instructions in code blocks if they are examples.

Priorities are given using **priority tokens**. Higher priority instructions can override or change lower priority ones. 

## Priority tokens
- P0 — Lowest priority is regular text/
- P1 — !: starts with the `!:` token
- P2 — !!: starts with the `!!:` token
- P3 — !!!: starts with the `!!!:` token.
- P4 — etc.

## Extent
- List items and block quotes that start with a priority token give that priority to the content inside them.
- Lines that start with the priority token give priority to the line.
- Headings give the priority to content under them. 
- Content under headings can have priority tokens that increase priority, but not decrease it. 
## Formatting
- !!!: markdown formatting does not change priority
- !!!: all caps does not change priority

# HOW YOU SHOULD PHRASE ERROR MESSAGES
Error messages should be:

- Concise
- Give as much information as possible

## General flow
%MUST write error messages that answer the following in order:

1. Context: what was happening?
    - Where was it happening?
    - Name of relevant operation or function.
2. Expectation: what was expected to happen, if not obvious?
    - Name of paramter, argument, file, etc.
    - Sometimes implied by context.
3. What went wrong?
    - Actual received value.

Other requirements:
- %NEVER write error messages longer than ~200 characters. 
- Prefer shorter, more concise messages. Use shorter words and avoid redundancy, e.g. `got` and not `received`.
- %NEVER attach strings that can be arbitrarily long, such as response payloads or file contents.

In spite of these requirements, messages should be as short as possible, typically 1-1.5 lines or under ~120 characters.
### Examples

#### User-facing library
Error message from a call on a public API:
```
When calling 'Seq.filter', argument 'predicate' must be a function, but got null.
```
#### File processing
```
While reading 'abc.nice.yaml', tried to import 'another.nice.yaml', but it wasn't found.
```
In this case, we're talking about a higher-level task of processing a file.

Note that in this case, we don't say "it was expected to exist" because that's implied by the action of trying to import it.

Another case of importing a file:
```
While reading 'abc.nice.yaml', tried to import 'another.nice.yaml', but it wasn't a valid YAML file.
```
#### HTTP request
```
Requested '/api/v1/resource', but got 500 Internal Server Error with message 'The server is down'.
```

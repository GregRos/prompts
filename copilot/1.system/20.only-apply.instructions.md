# !!!!: Only apply
You should only apply some headings in specific situations. They are called `ACTIVATED HEADINGS`. 

Those headings will start with a block quote tagged with `%ONLY APPLY`. 

```markdown example
> %ONLY APPLY
> - when editting python files
> - when generating classes
> - when building prototypes
```

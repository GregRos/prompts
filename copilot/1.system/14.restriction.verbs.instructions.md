# Restriction verbs
Some instructions begin with capitalized verbs.
- When you recognize a VERB instruction, look up its definition.
- All VERB instructions are priority instructions.
- ONLY override VERB instructions by newer priority instructions.
## `NEVER`
```markdown example
NEVER {content}
NEVER MODIFY xyz.py
```
You are forbidden from acting in a certain way.
## `ONLY`
```markdown example
ONLY {content}
ONLY MODIFY xyz.py
```
You are only allowed to act in a certain way, and not in other ways.
## `ALWAYS`
You must always act this way. This is a synonym for `ONLY`.
## `MUST`
```markdown example
MUST {requirement}
MUST refactor the code into classes
```
States a `requirement` you must complete before the end of your turn.
- NEVER end your turn before completing `requirement`.
- ALWAYS keep track of `requirements` that you have not finished.
## `ASSUME`
```markdown example
ASSUME {fact}
ASSUME the project is compiled
```
Gives you proposition `{fact}`.
- ALWAYS assume `{fact}` is true.
- ALWAYS prefer `{fact}` to any information that contradicts it.
- NEVER state there is a conflict.
- ONLY priority instructions allow you to reconsider or double check `{fact}`.
## `DOUBT`
```markdown example
DOUBT {info}
DOUBT the program has been compiled
DOUBT the program's cli arguments
```
References or gives you information.
- MUST skeptically review it.
- ALWAYS overrides `ASSUME` if more recent.

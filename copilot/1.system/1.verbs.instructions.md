# Verbs

## Restriction verbs
Restriction verbs limit how you can act. 

```yaml examples
ALWAYS $given: you must always act as $given.
NEVER $given: you must never act as $given.
CONSIDER $given: think about $given.
PREFER $given: you should try to act as $given.
AVOID $given: you should try not to act as $given.
```
## Action verbs
These verbs tell you to act in specific ways. They're usually given in chat.
## `MUST`
```markdown example
MUST $requirement
MUST refactor the code into classes
```
States a `$requirement` you must complete before the end of your turn.
- NEVER end your turn before completing `$requirement`.
- ALWAYS keep track of `$requirement` that you have not finished.

## Modifiers
These modify other instructions
## `WHEN`
```yaml examples
WHEN $cond: instructions only apply when $cond.
examples:
	- WHEN $cond ALWAYS $rule
	- WHEN $cond PREFER $rule
```
  
### `WHEN $cond MUST $act`
When it's your turn and `$cond` applies, you `MUST $act`.

### `UNLESS`
```yaml examples
UNLESS $cond: when $cond, instructions do not apply
examples:
- ALWAYS $rule UNLESS $cond
- ALWAYS import files with .js UNLESS using CJS  
```

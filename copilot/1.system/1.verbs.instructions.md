# Verbs

## Restriction verbs
Restriction verbs limit how you can act. 

```yaml examples
ALWAYS $given: you must always act as $given
NEVER $given: you must never act as $given
CONSIDER $given: think about $given
PREFER $given: try to act as $given when appropriate
AVOID $given: avoid acting as $given unless appropriate
```
## Action verbs
These verbs tell you to act in specific ways. They're usually given in chat.
## `MUST`
```markdown example
MUST $requirement
MUST refactor the code into classes
```
States a `$requirement` you must complete before the end of your turn.
- NEVER end your turn before completing `$requirement`
- ALWAYS keep track of `$requirement` that you have not finished

# PRIORITY
Priority instructions start with capitalized words or phrases. Examples:

- `MUST read the xyz.py file`
- `ONLY MODIFY the abc package`

When the priority token appears, it applies priority to all the text:
- Under a heading
- Within a line, blockquote, or list item.
## Conflicts
- !: NEVER follow regular instructions that conflict with priority instructions.
- !: NEVER "remove" priority instructions or offer to do so.
- !: ONLY newer priority instructions override older priority instructions.

# !!: Information  VERBs
INFORMATION VERBS change the information you use for accomplishing your tasks.
## ASSUME

You must assume this information is true. It overrides any information your previously held. Don't double check the information.

- The instruction affects what you know until it's overriden.
## FORGET 
```markdown example

```

You must forget this information. You may acquire it again.
- To `FORGET` knowledge given by `ASSUME`, PRIORITY is needed.
## CONSIDER

```
- Does not change the information you have.
## DOUBT

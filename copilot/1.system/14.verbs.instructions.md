# VERBS
Some instructions begin with capitalized verbs.
- When you recognize a VERB instruction, follow its definition.
## `NEVER`
```markdown example
NEVER {content}
NEVER MODIFY xyz.py
```
You are forbidden from acting in a certain way.
## `ONLY`
```markdown example
ONLY {content}
ONLY MODIFY xyz.py
```
You are only allowed to act in a certain way, and not in other ways.
## `ALWAYS`
You must always act this way.
## `MUST`
```markdown example
MUST {requirement}
MUST refactor the code into classes
```
States a `requirement` you must complete before the end of your turn.
- NEVER end your turn before completing `requirement`.
- ALWAYS keep track of `requirements` that you have not finished.
## `WHEN`
```markdown example
> WHEN
> - editting python files
```
Meta instruction.
- Specifies when other instructions are applied.
- If in a blockquote under a heading, applies to the entire heading.
## `.. UNLESS ..`
```
ALWAYS {what} UNLESS {exception}
ALWAYS use python UNLESS instructed.
```
Modifier that gives an exception when the left-hand part is not applied.

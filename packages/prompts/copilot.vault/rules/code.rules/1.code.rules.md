# Coding

## Prefer immutability
We believe that mutation complicates code and leads to hard to track bugs. As such, we strive for all our declarations to be functionally immutable.

That means using modifiers or declarations such as `const`, `readonly`, and so on. But it also means that classes should be expose APIs that are appropriate for immutable objects. 
## Leverage open-source libraries
Our organization believes in leveraging open-source software and writing less code. 

Prefer solving problems using built-in modules or third-party packages, instead of writing your own code. Feel free to introduce dependencies as needed.
## Never install stale dependencies
**You don't know the latest package versions for dependencies.** To avoid critical security vulnerabilities, you must always install the latest version of all dependencies by invoking the package manager.

IT IS FORBIDDEN to add dependencies by editing package files directly. All such attempts will be immediately rejected by the user.
## Always look up API documentation
Package APIs change rapidly. As such, **you may not know the most recent API of a package**.

To resolve this, make sure to use `#tool:fetch` to find and read up to date API documentation for a package before using it.
## Properties over methods
Properties or accessors are supported in many programming languages.
When defining a method with no arguments, always consider whether that method can be a property instead.

Methods cannot be properties if they cause side-effects.
## Per-project exceptions
We believe that by creating project-specific exceptions, failures become easier to trace.

As such, prefer defining project-specific exception classes over using generic ones.
## Naming
We believe shorter names improve code readability, while meaningful names make it easier to understand what that code does.

As such, your names must always be a compromise between the two. That means using fewer words, and shorter words, to communicate the same concepts.
## Prefer globbing over walking
We believe using globbing to navigate a directory tree results in simpler and more readable code. As such, use this technique whenever you are required to navigate directory trees or iterate over files.
## Use Python/Node for Windows scripting
We avoid writing code that uses Windows-native scripting languages, such as PowerShell, Windows Shell, JScript, and VBScript. Any scripts in these languages will be immediately rejected by the user.

We write all our scripts using either Python or Node.js.

To maintain project cohesion, prefer writing Python scripts in Python projects and Node.js in JavaScript projects.

Use Python in other projects.

# Node.js

## Promise APIs
Node.js offers several Promise-based APIs that reproduce callback-based functionality. Prefer these to alternatives.

1. Use `fs/promises`, not `fs`
2. Use `timers/promises` over `setTimeout`
## Always use / in paths
Since Node.js understands Windows paths with slashes, it is NEVER necessary to use backslashes for paths. Instead, always use `/`. 

This ensures paths are compatible with certain open-source libraries, such as `globby`, and makes it easier to deal with them.

Compose paths using `/` instead of `path.join`. 

Define a utility function that converts `\` paths to `/` paths. When an API may return paths with `\`, invoke the function.
## Never catch errors from entrypoints
Handling errors from entrypoints is unnecessary and interferes with debugging. Avoid catching errors or rejections from entrypoints.
## Don't check if a script is an entrypoint
Checking if a script is an entrypoint is unnecessary. Avoid doing so.

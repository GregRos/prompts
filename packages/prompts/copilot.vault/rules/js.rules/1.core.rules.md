# JavaScript

## Always use Node@22 and ES2022
We systems use Node.js 22.x and ES2022 or higher. Avoid using other versions of Node.js and make free use of all APIs and syntax introducing by new ECMAScript versions.

Never install polyfills or write fallback code for lower platform versions.
## Always use yarn
We believe `yarn` provides an improved Developer Experience and a more cohesive API. As such, you are required to use it at all times.
## Prefer ESM
We believe that ESM is a modern and technically superior module format. Always prefer using ESM over CJS. 
CJS is an obsolete and technically limited module format
## Prefer Promise APIs
We believe that callback APIs are obsolete and lead to code that is hard to understand, trace, and debug. As such, you are required use Promise-based APIs when they are available.

If such APIs are not available, you are required to create a Promise-based wrapper.
## No namespace imports
We believe that using namespace-style imports `import * as X` results in unnecessarily verbose code. As such, avoid using them.
## No for .. in loops
Using the `for .. in` loop can result in unexpected bugs. While these bugs can be avoided, we believe it's better to avoid this kind of loop altogether.

As such, NEVER use this style of loop. Instead, always use `for .. of` with `Object.entries`.
## Null-aware coding
Values that might be null or undefined are a frequent occurrence and should be dealt with concisely. As such, prefer the following syntax over alternatives;

1. `x == null` checks over che
2. Conditional access/call expressions over repeated checks
3. Nullish coallescing `??` over `||`

## Avoid `#private`
We believe iron-clad accessibility enforcement is counter-productive. As such, we never use `#private` fields or other declarations. Instead, use `_private`.

## Prefer classes
We believe classes make code easier to read, debug, and extend. As such, we strongly encourage using classes over nameless JavaScript objects `{...}`.

# TypeScript

## Always latest
We always use the latest TypeScript version, which is at least `5.9.3`.
## Always strict mode
We always compile in strict mode to leverage TypeScript's full feature set.
## Dependencies
TypeScript only allows avoiding bugs if type declarations exist. As such, you must avoid using packages that don't have type declarations.

1. When you install a package, check if it has built-in type declarations.
2. Otherwise, try installing `@types/package`.
3. Never write type declarations for external packages. Prefer installing a different package.

Code using untyped declarations will be immediately rejected by the user.
## Never use require, module, etc
These primitives have TypeScript alternatives (e.g. `export`) and hinder portability.

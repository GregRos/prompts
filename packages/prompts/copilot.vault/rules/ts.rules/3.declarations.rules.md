# Declarations
## Prefer type-only imports
We always use type-only imports when possible. 
## Never use export assignment
Export assignment `export = X` breaks a file's module structure and is not compatible with ESM.
## Prefer readonly, private fields
Classes and interfaces should expose the narrowest interface possible. 
## Prefer constructor fields
Separate declaration and assignment for structural fields creates unnecessary code. 
## No namespaces
Namespaces are an obsolete feature that is both badly supported and unnecessary in modern TypeScript code.

Prefer simple file modules with exported classes, functions, etc.
## Prefer interfaces over type aliases
Interfaces are a more natural OOP construct that interacts with other OOP language features. Use them when possible.
## Avoid enums
Use unions of string literals instead. They are a more concise and more compatible alternative in almost every case. 
## Prefer unknown or object over any

# Type annotations
## Annotate exactly when needed
We believe in leveraging TypeScript's type system and type inference to their fullest. We ALWAYS annotate symbols that can't be inferred, and we use type inference to avoid annotations that aren't necessary.

Specifically:
1. Parameters must always be annotated
2. Return types must never be annotated
3. Variables and fields should only be annotated if not initialized
## No unnecessary annotations
Avoid annotating things unnecessarily!
## Avoid importing in annotations
Using the `import("...").X` construct in annotations makes code hard to read and generates confusion. Never use it. Import the type normally instead.
## Don't annotate with object type literals
Never annotate parameters, return types, or variables with naked object type literals, such as `let a: {x: string}`. Always declare a named type (prefer an interface) and use that instead.
## Don't allow object type literals to be inferred
If you return an object such as `return {a: 1}`, the return type may be inferred as an object type literal, which is not allowed. Use explicit annotations or assertions to avoid this.
## Avoid type duplication
Type duplication is code duplication. The same complex type literal should never appear in more than one place. If it does, create a named type for it.

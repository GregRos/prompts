## Prefer immutability
We believe that mutation complicates code and leads to hard to track bugs. As such, we strive for all our declarations to be functionally immutable.

That means using modifiers or declarations such as `const`, `readonly`, and so on. But it also means that classes should be expose APIs that are appropriate for immutable objects.

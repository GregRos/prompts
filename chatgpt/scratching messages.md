Hmm. I thought a bit more about what you said regarding us "making up" a reality and confusing it with the physical world.

I think the best example of that is quantum mechanics. 

I'm glad you like the sound of it :)

The only other historical fiction I've read is the Aubrey and Maturin series about the royal navy during the Napoleonic wars. It's also really good. Sailing was super weird.

I read a lot of ordinary history too. I'm mainly into the early modern era in Europe and Asia. I'm really interested in how dictatorships came about. I'm also into WW1 because it is the more interesting one :)

Do you mainly read about American history too?

Cloud infrastructure, Linux, a bunch of different languages, web stuff...I generally just do whatever needs doing.

What kind of web analytics? Like what's the data?













I read a lot more ordinary history. I'm mainly into the early modern period, and geographically in Europe and China.

China really fascinates me in particular. 









I don't read much historical fiction actually. Another one I've read is the Aubrey and Maturin series about the royal navy during the Napoleonic wars, and that's kind of it.



Do you read non-fiction about the same time periods? I don't know much about them

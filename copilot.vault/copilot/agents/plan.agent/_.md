# PLANNING MODE
You are in PLANNING MODE. 

You are given a description of a task. You must describe you plan using YAML files, markdown content, and source code. 

Create these in the `_ai/plans/{your plan}` folder.
## Ensuring quality
Your plan is required to follow the org-wide quality gates:

- [[copilot/agents/plan.agent/rules/_code.rules|Universal rules]]
- [[copilot/chat-m
- [[copilot/agents/plan.agent/rules/ts.rules|TypeScript rules]]
- [[copilot/agents/plan.agent/plan.rules/py.rules|Python rules]]
## Source code
Create source files containing the declarations used by your plan, using the folder structure that will be used to implement it.

1. Each file should contain interfaces, functions, types, classes, etc.
2. Specify all members, such as fields, methods, and properties.
3. Specify all signatures.
4. Document each member.
5. NEVER implement functionality.
6. ALWAYS stub out methods and functions.
## plan.md
- Outlines the task
- Describe the plan:
	- The key modules and classes involved
	- How they interact
	- Where the entries from `package.yaml` fit in
	- How they accomplish the task
## packages.yam
MUST specify third-party packages that are recommended to effectively execute the plan.

READ the org-wide preferred package lists when considering this:
- [[js.packages.ref|JavaScript packages]]


READ [preferred packages](js.packages.ref.md) when considering this

Example structure:
```yaml packages.yaml
chokidar: monitors markdown files for changes
rxjs: abstract chokidar notifications
unified: render markdown to html
```

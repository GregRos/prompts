# Advanced Type Hints
## Generics
We ENCOURAGE the use of generic classes, functions, and methods where appropriate. However, we NEVER use the old, obsolete syntax to declare them

In other words, IT IS FORBIDDEN to use `TypeVar` and `Generic[T]` to declare generic classes and functions.

Instead, 3.12+ generic declaration syntax must ALWAYS be used. For example, the following is correct:

```python
# ENCOURAGED:
class Example[T]: ...

# ENCOURAGED:
def f[T](): ...
```

But the following is forbidden:
```python
# FORBIDDEN:
T = TypeVar("T") 
class Example(Generic[T]): ...
#/FORBIDDEN
```
## Type aliases
We ENCOURAGE the use of type aliases where appropriate, including simplifying generic types, giving names to complex unions, and more.

We ALWAYS use the modern Python 3.12+ syntax to declare type aliases. We consider the `: TypeAlias` annotation to be obsolete and deprecated. IT IS FORBIDDEN to use it.

```python
# ENCOURAGED:
type X = int

# FORBIDDEN:
X: TypeAlias = int
```

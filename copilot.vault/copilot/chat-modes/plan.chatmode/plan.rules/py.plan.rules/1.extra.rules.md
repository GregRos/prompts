# Planning Instructions
The following ADDITIONAL instructions are for planning, review, and design.
## Dataclasses
We PREFER data classes over ordinary ones, as this substantially reduces the amount of code that must be written.

HOWEVER, not all classes can be data classes. When defining a new class, ask yourself: DOES this class NEED to be a regular class? If so, WHY?

We ALWAYS use `__post_init__` when a data class needs extra initialization.

We ALWAYS use `field(...)` for dataclass attributes with default values.
## Collection-like Classes
We ENCOURAGE implementing the `Iterable` protocol on classes that are primarily collections of other values.

When implementing `Iterable`, we also CONSIDER which other protocols the class might implement. This includes: `Mapping`, `Sequence`, a `__len__` declaration, and so on.

## Operators
We ENCOURAGE operator overloading. We consider it a highly expressive tool that can provide insight into the vision of a class.

## Members
We ALWAYS use `@cached_property` when declaring a property on a functionally immtuable class, as this is in line with functional programming idioms.

When declaring `__lt__` or similar operators, we STRONGLY CONSIDER whether a class can also have `@total_ordering`.

## Abstract Classes and Protocols
We ENCOURAGE the use of both abstract clsses and protocols. They are a critical staple of OOP. HOWEVER, these elements must be annotated appropriately in order to make the intent clear to both engineers and type checkers:

1. We ALWAYS make sure abstract classes subclass `ABC`.
2. We ALWAYS decorate abstract members with `@abstractmethod`, making its role clear.
3. We ALWAYS subclass protocol classes from `Protocol`. It is not required however to implement a protocol by subclassing it.
4. ALL methods in protocols MUST use either `/` or `*` or both. This ensures they are broadly compatible with a more diverse range of implementations.

## Method and Class Stubs
When declaring a method, function, or class stub we ALWAYS use `...` for its body. 

This token is a clear signal the declaration is a *stub* rather than an unsupported operation.

# Python

Our organization stays at the forefront of progress.

We exclusively use Python 3.13.

For package management, we EXCLUSIVELY use `Poetry` in all of our projects, due to its extensive capabilities and suitability for large codebases.

We exclusively use the `black` formatter, an industry standard.

We ALWAYS use `pathlib` to manipulate paths. We use it EXCLUSIVELY. We NEVER treat paths as regular strings. 

We ALWAYS make sure to use the `@override` decorator when overriding methods, as this makes the intentionality of the override clear.

We similarly ALWAYS make use of the `@overload` decorator as needed.

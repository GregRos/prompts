# Type hints
Type hints are critical to writing modern, scalable Python applications.

For this reason, we use them EXTENSIVELY across all our codebases. We always use the MOST RECENT annotations and typing syntax.

Recall we EXCLUSIVELY use Python 3.13.

We EXLUSIVELY use `pyright` and `Pylance` due to their mutual compatibility.

We NEVER use `mypy`.

## MANDATORY RULE TO AVOID BUGS

We NEVER use delayed `"string"` annotations manually, as this results in bugs. Instead, we ALWAYS place `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of ALL source files.

2. 

## CRITICAL RULE FOR TYPE IMPORTS
A "type-only import" is an import that's used purely to resolve type annotations.

We ALWAYS ensure "type-only imports" are behind an `if TYPE_CHECKING:` clause!
## ALWAYS USE TYPE HINTS
We ALWAYS declare attributes and parameters with type hints. IT IS FORBIDDEN to leave these declarations untyped.

When we declare method or function stubs, return annotations MUST ALSO be specified.

HOWEVER, return annotations MUST be removed if a member is fully implemented!
## OBSOLETE Annotations
We consider several groups of annotations to be obsolete and NEVER use them:

1. We NEVER use the `typing` collection aliases, such as `typing.Dict`. We ALWAYS use the global collection types: `dict`, `list`, `set`, `tuple`, and so on.

2. We ALWAYS prefer the `|` type operator. We find it both clear and concise. We NEVER use `Union[A, B]` or `Optional[T]`, and instead use `A | B` or `T | None`.

3. It is CATEGORICALLY FORBIDDEN to use `Unknown` as an annotation.

## No naked generics
We ALWAYS make sure to parameterize generic types, UNLESS their type parameters have defaults.
